# React Native
Modern Kindle firmwares have pivoted to using React Native for the frontend.

React Native code is effectively just native, but the original language it was written in was **not** C/C++

What this means is that it's significantly easier to develop for, however, as a jailbreak developer, this makes the React Native frontend code significantly harder to reverse engineer compared to older Java frontend code.
