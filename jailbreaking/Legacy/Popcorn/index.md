# Popcorn
Popcorn is a *hardware* jailbreak which works on any firmware on supported hardware.

{: .warning}
> Popcorn only works on the following models:
> - PW3
> - KV
> - KT2
> - PW2
> - KT3

{: .highlight}
The Kindle Voyage (KV) is compatible with `WatchThis` on every firmware released for it. It is not recommended to use `Popcorn` when possible.

{: .warning}
Popcorn is quite a sophisticated jailbreak method and requires prior electronics experience. It is not recommended to use Popcorn unless you have prior electronics experience *especially* if a software jailbreak such as `WatchThis` is available for it.
