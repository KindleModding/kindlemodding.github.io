# Backing Up
8th Generation and older jailbroken Kindles can have their partitions backed up and restored in case of catastrophic failures.

{: .warning}
> This only works on Kindle's which are 8th generation or **OLDER**, such as:
> - PW2
> - PW3
> - KT2
> - KT3
> - KV
> - KOA
> 
> This is because newer devices such as the KT4/PW4 have different partition layouts as well as *secure boot*,  making it impossible to resture backed up partitions.
