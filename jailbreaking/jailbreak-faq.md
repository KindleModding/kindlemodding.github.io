# Frequently Asked Questions

We recommend reading this article before or after jailbreaking your Kindle device and share it with other people.

## General/Account
---

### Can I jailbreak without an Amazon account?

No.

### Can I jailbreak if my Kindle is blacklisted?

No. Return your Kindle and demand your money back.

### Can I remove my account after jailbreaking?

Yes, but you will have to log in again if you want to jailbreak from scratch. The jailbreak will still work whether you log back in or log out.

#### ok and what about logging back in?

did the answer above meant anything to you üíî?

### Can I un-jailbreak my Kindle?

Yes, perform a factory reset on the device, then install the same (or higher) firmware update.

### Will this get my Amazon account banned?

No reports of Amazon accounts being banned after jailbreaking have been reported so far. However, please refrain from telling support that you have modified your device.

### My Kindle updated to an unsupported firmware version! Can I still jailbreak?

No ü•Ä.

If you still want to update, disconnect the device from the internet (and forget all saved internet connections) and wait for a new jailbreak method (or patch) to be released. This may take months or even years.

### How do I get the Amazon store back again?

Delete the `.active_sandbox_folder` and reboot. By this point, you should have already disabled updates with `renametobin`.

### What does soft float and hard float firmware means?

After version 5.16.3, Kindles started using a hard float architecture (on-chip floating point unit) for most processing tasks, compared to the soft float architecture, which was emulated in software.

While the underlying system appears mostly the same, many internal changes have made a lot of jailbreaking tools and extensions unusable in modern Kindles.

This ultimately means that most extensions found on MobileRead won't work on hard float firmware unless explicitly stated (i.e NiLuJe's Screensaverhack).

## Apps and eBooks
---

### How do I read my Amazon ebooks within KOReader?

KOReader currently doesn‚Äôt (and likely never will) support the proprietary formats that Amazon converts all ebooks into (KFX, AZW3, and very limited support for MOBI). It is recommended to get all your books as EPUB and stored them in a separate folder for easy access.

### How do I read my Libby books?

You cannot use the Libby service within KOReader. However, you can get the EPUB file from Libby by following [this guide](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6059.htm).

### Will Libby/Readwise/GoodReads/Kindle Unlimited work on Kindle after jailbreaking?

Yes. Technically, jailbreaking doesn‚Äôt interfere with any of these services.

#### Can I use those applications within KOReader?

Unless there's a plugin for it, no.

### Can I install Android apps on my jailbroken Kindle (Libby, Nook, Webtoon)?

Unless there's a extension/port for any of them, no.

### Where can I download free ebooks?

**You can Google this.**

## KOReader
---

### What is the difference between the three KOReader options?

- `"Start KOReader"`: The designed way to start KOReader.
- `"Start KOReader (no framework)"`: Temporarily "kills" the Kindle UI to allocate more resources to KOReader.
- `"Start KOReader (ASAP)"`: Skips a couple of checks and starts KOReader as soon as possible.

### Do I have to launch KOReader through KUAL?

Not necessarily.

If  you're running hard float firmware, you can launch them with simple [scriplets](https://kindlemodding.org/kindle-dev/scriptlets.html). (BOOKLET SCRIPLETS HERE)

If you're running soft float firmware you can try installing the [KUAL booklet launcher (made by yparitcher)](https://github.com/yparitcher/KUAL_Booklet/tree/V1.4) extension. You can further customize both the booklet and the [KOR launcher with the coversetter made by Stanner ](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4222466&postcount=15).

## Technical

### Can I update/restart/downgrade my Kindle after jailbreaking?

Yes, but you must first disable the internet connection and enable automatic updates again (`Restore` option in renametobin) to avoid potential self-blocks or unwanted automatic updates.

When updating, ensure that the newer version supports or hasn't patched the jailbreak (currently, 5.18.1).

### How do I downgrade my Kindle?

[Read and follow this guide](https://kindlemodding.org/firmware-and-flashing/downgrading/#downgrading-your-kindle).

### How can I check that my device is jailbroken?

Type `;log mpri` into the search bar, if a message pop ups, you're jailbroken.

### How do I use Scriplets (.sh)?

As explained in the [Scriplets section](https://kindlemodding.org/kindle-dev/scriptlets.html#siptlets), copy the scriptlet file into the documents folder (`/mnt/us/documents`). Once you're in the library view mode on Kindle, simply click on it.

### How can I check that the automatic updates have been disabled?

Download the following scriplet: (OTA CHECKER SCRIPTLET HERE)

### How can I disable ADs?

Download the following scriplet: (AD DISABLING SCRIPTLET HERE)

### Is it possible to change screensavers in the native Kindle UI?

Yes, but it is not recommended at least on hard float firmware, as it is very easy to brick the device.

If you still want to change the screensavers, check the details of your default Kindle screensavers inside the `/usr/share/blanket/screensavers` folder and set the custom ones with the same name prefix and settings (bit-depth and colors). You can either replace or add them.

Please note that even after following these precautions, it is not guaranteed your device won‚Äôt be bricked, especially if you're using GIMP to export.

{: .note}
If you are, however, running soft float firmware prior to 5.16.2.1.1 you can install [NiLuJe's screensaver hack](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=195474). **Please do not make the mistake in installing this extension on hard float firmware.**

### I get a message saying "Failed to remount rootfs RO, waiting"!

This is expected, you can safely reboot your device manually (holding the power button until you get the `Restart` option)

### My device hasn't rebooted after the jailbreaking pop-up!

Unless the Kindle displays in small text the message: ‚ÄúYou are now ready to install the hotfix‚Äù, you can safely reboot and continue with the post-jailbreak instructions. If not, something wrong happened in the jailbreak process.

Remember to delete any automatic update file that might have appeared.

### What does the KFT option in the settings menu do?
