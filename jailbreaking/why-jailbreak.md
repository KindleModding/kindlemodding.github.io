# Why Jailbreak?

For those asking about Jailbreaking and the benefits:
- Gives you the ability to view/modify system files.
- This allows you to remove or modify restrictions or system files
- Allows devs to create mods or add-ons to extend the functionality of the device further.
- Why not?

Examples of what can be done (with the knowledge/capability):

- Custom screensavers
- Custom Fonts (old firmware*)
- 3rd party apps/features outside of the Amazon ecosystem
- [Downgrading](../firmware-and-flashing/downgrading.md)
- Installing [KOReader](../jailbreaking/post-jailbreak/koreader.md)

Potential Downsides:

- Could potentially void the warranty of the kindle
- Could brick (which makes it unusuable) the device
- You would not be able to use official updates from kindle as you could lose the jailbreak state.
- Security Risks

You always jailbreak at your own risk. If you don't know what you are doing or are unsure, do not do it.
