If an **“Unexpected error” error** occurs when you try to log in to the Kindle Store or **only the Kindle Store home page** is displayed, try the following solution:

1. Factory Reset Kindle
2. Before logging into your account - plug your Kindle into your PC, move the WinterBrake files to the root of your storage space
3. Log in account and enter airplane mode as soon as possible
4. Connect Kindle to PC and delete the cache directory at the path .active_content_sandbox/store/resource/LocalStorage (Skip this step if the LocalStorage directory does not exist)
5. Reboot Kindle
6. Open the Kindle Store on your Kindle
7. When prompted, click `yes` to turn off airplane mode
