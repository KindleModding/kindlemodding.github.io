# Getting Started
In order to jailbreak your Kindle, you will need to know which Kindle you have and then pick a method to jailbreak it.

## Figuring out which Kindle you have
Unlike Amazon, the Kindle Modding community, such as this Wiki and MobileRead reffers to Kindle models by their nicknames, ie: the `PW4` referring to the `Kindle Paperwhite (10th Generation)`

This can often get somewhat confusing, so to figure out which Kindle you have, simply view the Kindle's serial number and locate it on [this table](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle_Serial_Numbers)


{: .highlight }
You can find your serial number by going to `Settings` > `Device Options` > `Device Info`
Which will show a window in which you will be able to see your Kindle's serial number

## Choosing a method
Once you have your model, simply pick a jailbreaking method from this table:

[LanguageBreak](./LanguageBreak) is currently the recommended method, so use it when possible.
