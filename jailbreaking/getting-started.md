# Getting Started
In order to jailbreak your Kindle, you will need to know which Kindle you have and then pick a method to jailbreak it.

## Figuring out which Kindle you have
Unlike Amazon, the Kindle Modding community, such as this Wiki and MobileRead reffers to Kindle models by their nicknames, ie: the `PW4` referring to the `Kindle Paperwhite (10th Generation)`

This can often get somewhat confusing, so to figure out which Kindle you have, simply find the serial number and use this page to see what Kindle you have and what jailbreak method you should use: [Kindle Models](./kindle-models)

## Jailbreaking your Kindle
Once you have identified what Kindle model you have and the recommended jailbreak method, simply click on the link of find it in the navbar (the left part of this wiki) and follow the instructions there
