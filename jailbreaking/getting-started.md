# Getting Started
In order to jailbreak your Kindle, you will need to know which Kindle you have and then pick a method to jailbreak it.

## What Kindle Do You Have?
Unlike Amazon, the Kindle Modding community, such as this Wiki and MobileRead reffers to Kindle models by their nicknames, ie: the `PW4` referring to the `Kindle Paperwhite (10th Generation)`

This is important to note due to the fact that many Kindle jailbreaks only work on specific models.

## Questions about Jailbreaking?
Before attempting to jailbreak your Kindle, we strongly recommend reading the Kindle Jailbreak F.A.Q as it provides answers to common questions and issues.
