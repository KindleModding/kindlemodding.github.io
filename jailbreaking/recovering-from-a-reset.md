# Recovering From A Reset
If you factory reset your Kindle to a jailbroken state without first disabling `renametobin` (the `Restore` option), then your Kindle may be in a broken state, to fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Follow the [MRPI installation instructions](./post-jailbreak/installing-kual-mrpi/)
2. Follow the [Disable OTA instructions](./post-jailbreak/disable-ota.md)
3. Instead of choosing the `Rename` option, use the `Restore` option

If you come from an un-jailbreak attempt, you can also force an update by copying the firmware update file to your Kindle and, while still plugged in, hold down the power button until it restarts.
