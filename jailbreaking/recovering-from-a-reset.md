# Recovering From A Reset
If you reset your Kindle in a jailbroken state with `OTABlocker`, then your Kindle may be in a broken state, to fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Follow the [MRPI installation instructions](./post-jailbreak/installing-kual-mrpi/)
2. Follow the [Disable OTA instructions](./post-jailbreak/disable-ota.md)
3. Instead of choosing the `Rename` option, use the `Restore` option
