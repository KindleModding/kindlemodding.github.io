# Firmware and Flashing
It is possible to update your Kindle's firmware to a specific version, note, it is not possible to **DOWNGRADE** it to a specific version, only to update.

Additionally, with a `1.8v` Serial-to-USB Adapter soldered to your Kindle, it is possible to flash firmwares directly, *and even Android!*
