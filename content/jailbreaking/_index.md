# Jailbreaking Your Kindle
Jailbreaking a Kindle:
- Allows devs to create system modifications or extensions to extend the functionality of the device further.
- Also allows for the development of custom homebrew to run on the Kindle
- Why not?

## What can I do?
As a user, this gives you access to:
- Custom screensavers
- Custom fonts on firmwares that do not support it
- Homebrew such as apps, games and more
- [Downgrading your firmware](../firmware-and-flashing/downgrading)

<blockquote class="warning">
Please be aware of the risks of jailbreaking before you jailbreak your Kindle including, but not limited to:
- Potentially voiding the Kindle's waranty
- Bricking (permanently breaking) the device
- Security Risks
</blockquote>

Always jailbreak at your own risk.
If you don't know what you are doing or are unsure, don't do it.
