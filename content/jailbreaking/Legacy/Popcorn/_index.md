# Popcorn
Popcorn is a *hardware* jailbreak which works on any firmware on supported hardware.

<blockquote class="warning">
Popcorn only works on the following models:
- PW3
- KV
- KT2
- PW2
- KT3
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="info">
The Kindle Voyage (KV) is compatible with `WatchThis` on every firmware released for it. It is not recommended to use `Popcorn` when possible.
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="warning">
Popcorn is quite a sophisticated jailbreak method and requires prior electronics experience. It is not recommended to use Popcorn unless you have prior electronics experience *especially* if a software jailbreak such as `WatchThis` is available for it.
