# Backing Up
8th Generation and older jailbroken Kindles can have their partitions backed up and restored in case of catastrophic failures.

<blockquote class="warning">
This only works on Kindle's which are 8th generation or **OLDER**, such as:
- PW2
- PW3
- KT2
- KT3
- KV
- KOA

This is because newer devices such as the KT4/PW4 have different partition layouts as well as *secure boot*,  making it impossible to resture backed up partitions.
