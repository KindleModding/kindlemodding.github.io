# Recovering From A Reset
If you reset your Kindle in a jailbroken state with `renametobin` left enabled, your Kindle may be in a locked state, to fix this, perform the following steps:

1. Follow the [MRPI installation instructions](./post-jailbreak/installing-kual-mrpi/)
2. Follow the [Disable OTA instructions](./post-jailbreak/disable-ota.html)
3. Instead of choosing the `Rename` option, use the `Restore` option

If you come from an un-jailbreak attempt, you can also force an update by copying the firmware update file to your Kindle and, while still plugged in, hold down the power button until it restarts.
